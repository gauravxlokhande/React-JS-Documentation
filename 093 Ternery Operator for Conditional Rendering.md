The ternary operator in JavaScript is a concise way to perform conditional operations. It is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands, hence the name "ternary." It's often used as a shorthand for the `if...else` statement.

### Syntax

The syntax for the ternary operator is as follows:

```javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

### Explanation

- `condition`: This is the condition you want to evaluate. If this condition evaluates to `true`, the `expressionIfTrue` is executed. If it evaluates to `false`, the `expressionIfFalse` is executed.
- `expressionIfTrue`: This is the expression that gets executed if the condition is `true`.
- `expressionIfFalse`: This is the expression that gets executed if the condition is `false`.
